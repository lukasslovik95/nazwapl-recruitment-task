## Contribution
If you want to edit this project you have to:
1. Open project folder in any IDE with console
2. Open console and install npm for node_modules (I'm using Bootstrap v. 5.2 in this project)
```
npm install
```
3. Run script which will bundle all `.scss` files
```
npm run start
```
Now you can edit `.scss` files. Whenever you save a change it will bundle all styles to `.css` file.
